# John Tocci — I build automation that deletes busywork

I design and ship **data-driven automation** that turns messy ops into push-button workflows. Skeptical by default, biased toward shipping, and allergic to manual reconciliations. If it isn’t automatable, I want to know why.

---

## How I operate
**Automate first**; if a human did it twice, code should do it the third time.  
**Keep receipts**; every step logs inputs, decisions, and outputs.  
**Ship thin, iterate fast**; small PRs beat “big bang” refactors.  
**Numbers must reconcile**; if totals don’t foot, the story doesn’t fly.  
**Boring > clever**; reliability outperforms cute hacks.

## Tools that earn their keep
Python • Polars/Pandas • NumPy • SQL • Postgres/TimescaleDB • DuckDB • Docker  
Flask/FastAPI • React (when needed) • Cron/Airflow • Alteryx/Power Query • Playwright/BS4

---

## What you’ll find here
Utilities, opinionated templates, and tiny services that favor **clarity, tests, idempotency, and observability**. No sales decks. No motivational posters. Just code that reduces work.

## Collaboration
Open an issue with `[question]` or `[proposal]` in the title.  
Brief, reproducible examples get priority.
